### Hello and welcome! 👋

Thank you for visiting my profile. I would like to provide you with some brief information about myself:
- 👨‍💻 I am an experienced software developer and entrepreneur with a specialization in C/C++ programming, and I have a great passion for it.
- 👀 My interests lie in exploring and experimenting with technologies in robotics, embedded systems, and IoT edge.
- 🚀 During my free time, I have devoted myself to developing the open source [AREG SDK](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk) with great enthusiasm.

The AREG SDK is an innovative development platform designed to equip developers with a lightweight and intelligent communication engine, and comprehensive set of tools to construct complex interactive systems at the edge of IoT networks. As a regular speaker at conferences, I have had the opportunity to present my ideas and demonstrate the full range of capabilities that the AREG SDK has to offer. You can download the [AREG IoT SDK whitepaper](https://github.com/aregtech/aregtech/blob/main/docs/areg-sdk-distributed-services-whitepaper.pdf), which focuses on distributed solutions for embedded applications. The whitepaper was prepared for from the [embedded world Exhibition&Conference](https://www.embedded-world.de/) global platform for the embedded community. I am confident that the AREG SDK will be a valuable solution for developers and businesses.

I welcome C/C++ developers to join me in further developing the [AREG engine](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk). I also invite C# developers to contribute to the cross-platform [AREG SDK GUI tool](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk-tools) development. Please give AREG SDK a try and leave a rating ⭐, even if it doesn't meet your expectations 😜.

Let's have fun developing with AREG SDK!
