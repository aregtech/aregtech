### Welcome 👋

**Distributed C++ systems are notoriously hard. [Areg SDK](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk) makes them simple.**  
I build the high-performance open-source framework that removes the boilerplate and pain from multi-threaded, multi-process, and multi-node communication.

I work primarily in C/C++ and focus on distributed architectures, embedded systems, robotics, and real-time edge solutions.

## Why Areg Matters

Most applications today need concurrency, resilience, and distribution. Traditional IPC, queues, and orchestration quickly turn into a mess. Areg SDK fixes this with a minimal, fast, and deterministic service model built for real systems:

- Runs from tiny embedded setups to full distributed networks  
- Replaces complex IPC with clean, generated Service Interfaces  
- Guarantees predictable, message-driven behavior  
- Fits embedded, desktop, and edge-to-cloud applications  
- Enables rapid scaling without rewriting architecture

Areg is for projects that want raw performance without the complexity.

## How Areg Works

- Clean abstraction with Service Providers and Service Consumers  
- Generated APIs for requests, responses, and service data  
- High-speed, low-overhead messaging with CRC-based addressing for instant routing  
- Lusan GUI tool for visual design, testing, and multi-process logging  
- Fully free and open-source, and ready for integration into any C++ project
