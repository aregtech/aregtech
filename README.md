### Welcome 👋

**Building high-performance, distributed C++ frameworks that make multi-threaded, multi-process, and edge applications simple, reliable, and scalable. Open-source Areg SDK turns complex messaging, service orchestration, and system distribution into an effortless developer workflow.**

I am a developer and entrepreneur passionate about C/C++ with experience in C# and Java. My focus spans robotics, embedded systems, IoT edge, and distributed application frameworks.

## Why Areg Matters

Complex distributed systems are hard to build, maintain, and debug. Areg SDK solves this with a **lightweight, high-performance communication and service orchestration engine**, empowering developers to focus on logic instead of plumbing. It is not just IoT—Areg scales from **multi-threaded applications on a single device** to **distributed multi-node systems**, making it ideal for embedded, desktop, and cloud-connected applications.

## How Areg Works

- **Virtualized communication:** Proxies and Stubs abstract clients and servers, supporting multiple threads and processes seamlessly.  
- **Message-driven architecture:** Service Interfaces define requests, responses, and attributes in a deterministic, fast, and type-safe way.  
- **Optimized delivery:** Efficient mapping, CRC-based addressing, and lightweight protocols ensure high throughput and low latency.  
- **Developer tools:** Cross-platform GUI utilities (Lusan tool) for designing Service Interfaces, inspecting logs, testing, and debugging.  
- **Extensible & open-source:** Easily integrate with existing C++ projects and extend with your own modules.
