### Hello and welcome! 👋

Some brief information about myself:
- 👨‍💻 I am a developer and entrepreneur with a passion for C/C++. As well develop with C# and Java.
- 👀 My interests lie in exploring and experimenting with technologies in robotics, embedded systems, and IoT edge.
- 🚀 In my free time, I have devoted myself to developing the open source [AREG SDK](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk) with enthusiasm.

The AREG SDK is an innovative development platform equipped with a lightweight and intelligent communication engine, and comprehensive set of tools to build complex interactive systems at the edge of IoT networks. As a regular conference speaker, I have showcased the capabilities of AREG SDK. Check out the [AREG IoT SDK whitepaper](https://github.com/aregtech/aregtech/blob/main/docs/areg-sdk-distributed-services-whitepaper.pdf), which focuses on IoT edge-centric and distributed solutions for embedded applications, prepared for the [embedded world Exhibition&Conference](https://www.embedded-world.de/) global platform for the embedded community. I am confident that the AREG SDK will be a valuable solution for developers and businesses.

I welcome **C/C++ developers** to join in further development of the [AREG engine](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk). I also invite **C# developers** to contribute to the cross-platform [AREG SDK GUI tool](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk-tools) development.

AREG SDK is a project that I have poured my heart into. Try it out and leave a rating ⭐, even if it doesn't meet your expectations 😜. Let's have fun developing open source!
