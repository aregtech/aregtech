### Hi there 👋

If very short about me:
- 👩‍💻 I'm in SW development so long that makes no sense to write years.
- 🎯 Mainly developing in C/C++, which I love.
- 👀 Interested in robotics, embedded, IoT edge applications, and many other technologies.

Most of free time i spend to develop [AREG SDK](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk) 🚀, which i create with 💖. 
Try it and ⭐ it, even if you didn't like it 😜.

C/C++ developers are welcomed to join to develop [AREG engine](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk) firther.
C# developers are welcomed to join cross-platform [AREG SDK GUI tool](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk-tools) development.
I hope what I started to do is helpful for developers and businesses. I have a clear view how AREG SDK should work and what tools should have.

Have fun!
